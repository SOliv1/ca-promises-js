##### Constructing a Promise Object
Letâ€™s construct a promise! To create a new Promise object, we use the new keyword and the Promise constructor method:
>const executorFunction = (resolve, reject) => { };
>const myFirstPromise = new Promise(executorFunction);
The Promise constructor method takes a function parameter 
called the executor function which runs automatically when the constructor is called. 
The executor function generally starts an asynchronous operation and dictates how the promise should be settled.
